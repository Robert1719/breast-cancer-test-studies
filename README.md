Breast Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning.
This analysis aims to observe which features are most helpful in predicting malignant or benign cancer and to see general trends that may aid us in model selection and hyper parameter selection. The goal is to classify whether the breast cancer is benign or malignant. To achieve this i have used machine learning classification methods to fit a function that can predict the discrete class of new input.
I was able to identify that out of the 569 persons, 357 are labeled as B (benign) and 212 as M (malignant).
